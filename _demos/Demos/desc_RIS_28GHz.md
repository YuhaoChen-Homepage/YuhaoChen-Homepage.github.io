      <h5 class="card-title">RIS-Assisted Communication Prototype with a 28 GHz RIS with 2304 elements</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        This prototype integrates a 2304-element RIS and an AI-based end-to-end architecture, which operates at 28 GHz. With the directional beam generated by RIS, the signal coverage is extended. In addition, an end-to-end system is trained off-line and deployed on the FPGA, which makes the constellation deviate from the traditional QAM structure.
