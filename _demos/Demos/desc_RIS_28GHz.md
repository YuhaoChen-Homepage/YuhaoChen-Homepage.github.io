<!-- <div class="p-4">
    <div class="card-img-overlay" style="overflow: scroll; background: rgb(255,255,255,0.8); height: 295px;">
      <h5 class="card-title">AI-based Communication Prototype with a 2304-element RIS @ 28 GHz</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        This prototype integrates a 2304-element RIS and an AI-based end-to-end architecture, which operates at 28 GHz. With the directional beam generated by RIS, the signal coverage is extended. In addition, an end-to-end system is trained off-line and deployed on the FPGA, which makes the constellation deviate from the traditional QAM structure.
