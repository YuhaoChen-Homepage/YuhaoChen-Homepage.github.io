  <h5 class="card-title">Communication Prototype with a 64-element active RIS @ 3.5 GHz</h5>
  <p class="card-text">
    This prototype integrates a 64-element active RIS, which operates at 3.5 GHz. To overcome the “multiplicative fading” effect in RIS systems, each element is integrated with an amplifier to simultaneously amplify and reflect the impinging signal.
